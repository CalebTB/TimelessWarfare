Timeless Warfare Checklist

Things to do in Order:
	(1.) get_Grid_Working
	(X) get_Towers_Implemented (work with placement)
		In Addition to Towers:
			(X) Health
			(X) Damage
			(2.3) Sell/Buy/Upgrade***
			(2.4) Moveable after Placement
			(X) Area of Attack
	(2.B) get_Walls_Implemented


Things I think that can be done outside of Order:
	(1.) AI Tracking Towards Target 
		(1.1) Spawn Points
		(1.2) Health
		(1.3) Damage
		(1.4) Round Based Spawns
		(1.5) Figure Out how to do the round based to where it can increment easily without hard coding everything
	(2.) Assets for Towers
	(3.) Assets for Enemies 
	(4.) GUI
		(4.1) Indicators for health???

What I added:
	(1) Tower Placement
	(2) Gold and Health and ability to buy towers
	(3) Spawn Point to test killing enemies
	(4) Ability to Shoot
	(5) Some other core mechanics to get the ball rolling

What still needs to improved:
	(1.) If you can get grid placement working go for it if not make it to where towers cant be placed on top of each other
		(1.1) Fix the visual that should show where the tower is being placed right now you have to guess where it going to placed.
		(1.2) I think the camera has somwthing to do with the placement of towers being far right of where your mouse is but I dont know
	(2.) Round based enemies
	(3.) Fixed the bug where the tower rotates and make it to where only the arrow is rotating.
	(4.) Add upgradables if you want but make it less of a priority
	(5.) Add walls if you want but I doubt we will get that going
	(6.) If you want to fix the Ai, do it. But right now i just have it following a path then killing itself once it hits the Queen. If you keep the same Ai then add more spawn points from the other three sides.
	(7.) Make towers sellable if you want, may be more of a pain than you think, maybe not. The videos help alot tho with these things
	(8.) Add more towers too. 
	(9.) Add more enemies too. Both things are pretty straight forward, but they may require separate scripts for each new tower and enemy with a few things changed to make them different.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think that is it for things that need to be done but I could be wrong, if you come up with anything else
add it in.
