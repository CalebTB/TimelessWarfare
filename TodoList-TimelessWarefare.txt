Timeless Warfare Checklist

*** = do it if we have time, if not just keep base level for time being
(what camera angle do we want? Top Down? Slight Angle?) 
	[I think Top Down would be best bet for us]

Things to do in Order:
	(1.) get_Grid_Working
	(2.) get_Towers_Implemented (work with placement)
		In Addition to Towers:
			(2.1) Health
			(2.2) Damage
			(2.3) Sell/Buy/Upgrade***
			(2.4) Moveable after Placement
			(2.5) Area of Attack
	(2.B) get_Walls_Implemented


Things I think that can be done outside of Order:
	(1.) AI Tracking Towards Target 
		(1.1) Spawn Points
		(1.2) Health
		(1.3) Damage
		(1.4) Round Based Spawns
		(1.5) Figure Out how to do the round based to where it can increment easily without hard coding everything
	(2.) Assets for Towers
	(3.) Assets for Enemies 
	(4.) GUI
		(4.1) Indicators for health???
