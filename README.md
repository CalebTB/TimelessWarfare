Question - How should the enemy players behave?

Game overview - The game board is shaped as a square and enemies spawn from the four middle points along each line of the outer boundary of the square.
The enemies’ goal is to destroy the queen in the most efficient way possible.  Players can place walls (slow down the enemy) and towers (do damage to the enemy).

Enemy behavior – Enemies will proceed in a straight line to the queen and when encountering walls will move left or right until there is no obstruction in which case they will then proceed in a new straight line to the queen.
If another obstruction blocks a move left or right the enemy will then work to destroy the wall that it was attempting to find a way around (i.e. the old wall that prompted the move left/right and not the new wall obstructing the move left/right).
In this way, the enemy will all attack the same section of the wall that is blocking them without having to use any more complicated methods to teach the enemy to attack as a group.
Enemies will destroy towers if they are in the direct path of the queen but will not go out of their way to attack towers even if they are taking damage from them.
